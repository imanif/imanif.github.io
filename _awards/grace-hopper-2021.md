Imani was sponsored by the Cornell University Ann S. Bowers College of Computing and Information Science College of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to virtually attend the 2021 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference. Imani was selected for this, in part, due to her community leadership as Events Chair of Underrepresented Minorities in Computing (URMC) at Cornell.

The objective of the [Baggett Fellowships program](https://linguistics.umd.edu/academic-programs/graduate/baggett) is to provide intensive research training for post-baccalaureate students who wish to pursue a research career in the scientific study of language. Fellows will be exposed to a range of methods and tools for studying human language in the context of a collaborative research environment. Fellows will be fully engaged in the scientific investigation of fundamental questions about the human language capacity: How is linguistic knowledge represented in the mind? What types of computation are involved?

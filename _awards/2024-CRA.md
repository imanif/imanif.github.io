I was selected for Honorable Mention of the 2024 Computing Research Association's (CRA) Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award (URA).
This award commends recipients for their contributions to multiple research projects, several authored or coauthored multiple research papers, many presented their work at large-scale conferences, and others produced software artifacts that are now widely used. The nominee pool featured multiple nominations for students who successfully completed summer research or internship programs, and many students served their community as teaching assistants, tutors, and mentors.

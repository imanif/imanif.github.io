Hi! I'm a [post-baccalaureate research fellow](https://linguistics.umd.edu/academic-programs/graduate/baggett) in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Maryland, advised by Dr. Naomi Feldman. At UMD, my research investigates prompt optimization for LLM evaluation. I am also part of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing](https://ischool.umd.edu/centers-and-labs/clip/) (CLIP) Lab and volunteer with the [African American Digital & Experimental Humanities](https://aadhum.umd.edu/) (AADHum) Lab.

Broadly, my research interests include natural language generation, user-AI interaction, and AI policy. Specifically, **my research centers on understanding how language models will impact literature and communication.** I aim to identify LLM-generated texts, understand their societal impact, and propose how we might responsibly respond to this media.

Previously, I've had the opportunity to work with those from the Johns Hopkins Center for Natural Language Processing, Google, Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Universit√© du Mans (LIUM), and the Brown University Visual Computing Lab. I received my B.A. from Cornell University with honors for my [thesis](http://imanif.github.io/files/Finkley_HonorsThesis.pdf) that examined generative AI's impact on the literary tradition and the notion of authorship. 

In my free time, I like to watch anime, discover new restaurants, travel, and reading from my evergrowing TBR list. After learning Mandarin and (some) Danish, I am currently trying to add French to my foreign language repertoire!

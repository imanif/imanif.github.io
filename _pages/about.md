Hi! I am a [post-baccalaureate research fellow](https://linguistics.umd.edu/academic-programs/graduate/baggett) in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Maryland, advised by Dr. [Naomi Feldman](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/). At UMD, my research investigates prompt engineering and LLM memorization. In Autumn 2025, I am excited to start my PhD in Information Science at the [University of Washington](https://ischool.uw.edu/), advised by Dr. [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/).

Broadly, my research interests include natural language generation, user-LLM interaction, and AI policy. Specifically, **my research centers on understanding how language models will impact literature and communication.** I aim to evaluate LLM-generated texts, understand their societal impact, and propose how we might responsibly respond to this media.

I've also had the opportunity to work with those from the Johns Hopkins Center for Natural Language Processing, Google, Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Universit√© du Mans (LIUM), and the Brown University Visual Computing Lab. I received my B.A. from Cornell University with honors for my [thesis](http://imanif.github.io/files/Finkley_HonorsThesis.pdf) that examines generative AI's impact on the literary tradition and the notion of authorship. 

In my free time, I like to practice ballet, watch anime, [travel](https://imaniintl.wordpress.com/]), and learn new languages (currently, French).

I am receiving my undergraduate degree from Cornell University, where I study literature and computer science. I am driven to study the intersection between literature, language, and computation. My background ranges from NLP researcher to media assistant because, ultimately, I want to understand how we communicate and engage with one another. Further, in this age of AI, I am excited to drive forward research that investigates how LLMs and AI-generated media enhance and alter communication and creativity. 


Some fun facts about me are that I love ballet and anime, but if you donâ€™t catch me engaged in either, I am most likely reading a book from my ever-growing reading list (always on the lookout for recommendations!). Also, I love language and after learning Mandarin and Danish, I am currently trying to add French to my repertoire.

Imani graduated from Cornell University with a B.A. in Literatures in English and extensive experience in machine learning and data science. Currently, she is a Baggett Post-bacc Fellow at the University of Maryland Department of Linguistics performing computational linguistics research focusing on linguistics decisions in LLMs and taking linguistics and computer science coursework at UMD. Imani is driven to study the intersection between literature, language, and computation. Her background ranges from NLP researcher to media communications assistant because, ultimately, she wants to understand how we communicate and engage with one another. Further, in this age of AI, Imani is excited to drive forward research that investigates how LLMs and AI-generated media enhance and alter communication and creativity.  


Some fun facts about Imani are that she loves ballet and anime, but if you donâ€™t catch her engaged in either, she is most likely reading a book from her ever-growing reading list (always on the lookout for recommendations!). Also, she loves language and after learning Mandarin and Danish, she is currently trying to add French to her foreign language repertoire.

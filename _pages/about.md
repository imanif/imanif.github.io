Hi! I am a first-year Information Science PhD student at the [University of Washington](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/phd), advised by Dr. [Melanie Walsh](https://melaniewalsh.org/).

Broadly, my research interests include natural language generation, user-LLM interaction, and AI policy. Specifically, **my research centers on understanding how language models will impact literature and communication.** I aim to evaluate LLM-generated texts, understand their societal impact, and propose how we might responsibly respond to this media.

Before UW, I was a [post-baccalaureate research fellow](https://linguistics.umd.edu/academic-programs/graduate/baggett) at the University of Maryland, advised by Dr. [Naomi Feldman](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/). I've also had the opportunity to work with those from the Johns Hopkins Center for Natural Language Processing, Google, Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Universit√© du Mans (LIUM), and the Brown University Visual Computing Lab. I received my B.A. from Cornell University with honors for my [thesis](http://imanif.github.io/files/Finkley_HonorsThesis.pdf) that examines generative AI's impact on the literary tradition and the notion of authorship. 

In my free time, I like to practice ballet, watch anime, [travel](https://imaniintl.wordpress.com/), and learn new languages (currently, French).

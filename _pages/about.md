Hi, I'm Imani! I'm a [post-baccleaurate research fellow](https://linguistics.umd.edu/academic-programs/graduate/baggett) in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Maryland, advised by Dr. Naomi Feldman. At UMD, my research investigates prompt optimization for natural language generation. I am also affiliated with the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing](https://ischool.umd.edu/centers-and-labs/clip/) (CLIP) Lab and the [African American Digital & Experimental Humanities](https://aadhum.umd.edu/) (AADHum) Lab.

My research covers centers on understanding how language models will impact literature and communication. How will the growing presence of LLMs influence how we consume and produce literature? Further, can language technology be leveraged to diversify, expand, and challenge literary forms and media? To answer this, I approach LLM outputs as:
- linguistic objects,
- sociocultural objects,
- and historical objects
My goal is to contribute to how we properly identify, understand, and responsibly regulate AI-generated media.

Previously, I've had the opportunity to work with those from the Johns Hopkins Center for Natural Language Processing, Google, Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Universtie du Mans (LIUM), and the Brown University Visual Computing Lab. I received my B.A from Cornell University. My undergraduate honors thesis examined generative AI's impact on the literary tradition and the future of authorship. 

In my free time, I like to watch anime, discover new restaurants, travel, and read a book from my ever-growing reading list. After learning Mandarin and (some) Danish, I am currently trying to add French to my foreign language repertoire.

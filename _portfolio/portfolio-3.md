hyggeLIGHT is an atmospheric 2D platformer [desktop-only game](https://www.benno-lueders.de/dis/2023SpringGames/2dplatformer/hyggelight) developed in Unity. In Danish culture, 'hygge' roughly translates to a feeling of coziness and warmth. Inspired by this, my team and I developed this game that follows a candle as it hopes to light up, and bring hygge, to a home during a blackout.

*Global EdQuest* is an [application](http://4300showcase.infosci.cornell.edu:5168/) that recommends Cornell-approved study abroad programs based on user information and input-text-queries. Using text mining and social information, this goal of this project is to use reviews of study abroad programs from studyabroad101.com to provide users with a curated list of study abroad programs. Imani's role on this project was as a backend engineer, where she trained and tested a random forest classifier to perform sentiment analysis on program reviews and input queries. This project was a collaborative effort and final project for CS4300 (Language and Information) at Cornell University.
